# Summary Report: Power BI Dashboard Development for High-Level Business Requirements

## Introduction:
This summary report encapsulates the development process and outcomes of creating two Power BI dashboards: EXPLORE and DECIDE, to meet specific high-level business requirements derived from provided datasets. The project aimed to harness the capabilities of Power BI to visualize and analyze data effectively, enabling users to derive actionable insights and support decision-making processes.

## Problem Statement:
The primary objective was to develop Power BI dashboards that address the following key business requirements:
1.	Display total population by state and county.
2.	Identify the highest populated county within each state.
3.	Visualize population growth rates at the county-level since 2016.
4.	Display the percentage of insured individuals at the county-level (where available).
5.	Display the percentage of uninsured individuals at the county-level (where available).
6.	Group the percentage of insured and uninsured individuals into different buckets for comparative analysis.
   
Additionally, the solution was designed to include two dashboards: 
* EXPLORE: offering comprehensive data exploration capabilities
* DECIDE: providing concise insights for management-level decision-making.

## Methodology:
The development process encompassed several key steps:
Data Preparation:
The provided datasets were imported into Power BI and underwent thorough cleansing to address missing values, standardize formats, and ensure data consistency.

## Data Modeling:
A robust data model was designed to support the visualization requirements outlined in the business objectives. Relationships between relevant tables were established, and measures for calculations such as population growth rate and percentages of insured/uninsured individuals were defined.

## Dashboard Development:
Utilizing Power BI's intuitive interface, two dashboards were developed:
* EXPLORE Dashboard: This dashboard facilitates in-depth data exploration through a variety of interactive widgets such as filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities. Various visualizations including maps, bar charts, and line graphs are utilized to present data comprehensively.
* DECIDE Dashboard: Catering to management-level stakeholders, this dashboard provides concise insights and key metrics derived from the core data sources. Visualizations are streamlined and focus on critical aspects of the data, aiding in swift decision-making.

## Comment:
Every effort has been made to eliminate introducing detriments; however, there are a few logic bugs that require attention for future revisions.  

## Results:
The developed Power BI dashboards effectively met the high-level business requirements: 
* Total Population Display: The dashboards provide clear displays of total population by state and county, offering a comprehensive demographic overview.
* Highest Populated County Identification: Each state's highest populated county is accurately identified, aiding in demographic analysis and resource allocation decisions.
* Population Growth Rate Visualization: Population growth rates at the county-level since 2016 are visualized, enabling users to identify trends and patterns over time.
* Percentage of Insured and Uninsured Individuals: Where available, the dashboards display the percentage of insured and uninsured individuals at the county-level, providing insights into healthcare coverage distribution.
* Segmentation of Insured and Uninsured Individuals: The percentage of insured and uninsured individuals is segmented into different buckets for comparative analysis, facilitating trend identification and disparity analysis.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the development of EXPLORE and DECIDE Power BI dashboards successfully addressed the high-level business requirements, offering powerful tools for data exploration and decision-making. Leveraging Power BI's capabilities, users can derive actionable insights from the provided datasets, supporting informed decision-making processes within the organization.

## Recommendations for Future Work:
Enhance interactivity features to further engage users.
Integrate advanced analytics for predictive modeling and forecasting.
Provide user training and support to maximize dashboard utility.
This summary report provides a concise overview of the Power BI dashboard development process and outcomes, highlighting the project's success in meeting high-level business requirements and supporting data-driven decision-making.
